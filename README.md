# CKAD Hands-On Exercises

## Introduction

The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) program is designed to help you demonstrate your proficiency in designing, building, configuring, and exposing cloud-native applications for Kubernetes. The exam focuses on the following key areas:

1. Core Concepts (13%)
2. Configuration (18%)
3. Multi-Container Pods (10%)
4. Observability (18%)
5. Pod Design (20%)
6. Services & Networking (13%)
7. State Persistence (8%)

This README provides a comprehensive set of hands-on exercises covering each section of the CKAD curriculum. These exercises are structured to simulate real-world scenarios and exam conditions, helping you practice and reinforce your knowledge.

## How to Use These Exercises

1. **Setup:** Each exercise comes with a setup script that prepares the environment. Run the setup script to create necessary resources and configurations.
2. **Exercise:** Follow the intermediate exercises to complete the given tasks. These tasks are designed to mimic real-world scenarios you may encounter in the CKAD exam.
3. **Solution:** Solutions are provided to help you verify your work and understand the correct approach to solving each problem.
4. **Cleanup:** After completing the exercises, run the cleanup script to reset the environment. This ensures that there are no leftover resources that could interfere with future exercises.

## Structure of the Exercises

Each section contains multiple scenarios, each with the following structure:
- **Setup Script:** Prepares the environment for the exercise.
- **Intermediate Exercise:** Describes the tasks you need to complete.
- **Solution:** Provides the correct solution to the tasks.
- **Cleanup Script:** Resets the environment by deleting resources created during the setup.
